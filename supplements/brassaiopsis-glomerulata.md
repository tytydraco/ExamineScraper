Sources

Brassaiopsis glomerulata (of the family Araliaceae) is a deciduous tree found in the north Vietnam regions of Phucyen and Vinhphuc; It appears to have limited medicinal usage for treating rheumatism and back pain in elderly persons.[1]

Not fully elucidated, but appears to have a general assortment of triterpenoids that may be unique to this plant

Pharmacology

2.1

Enzymatic Interactions

In vitro at 20mcg/mL, a hexane-soluble extract appears to reduce aromatase activity t0 6.9-7.2% of the activity of untreated control cells, which appeared to also apply to the ethyl acetate fraction (37-59.3% of control).[2] When looking at molecules which could underlie this aromatase inhibition, it was found that (−)-dehydrololiolide (21.8% of control activity at 50μM in a cell culture) was able to potently inhibit aromatase to a degree that was not statistically different than letrozole (10nM); additionally, N-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester (33.3% of control activity) and 6β-Hydroxystigmasta-4-en-3-one was weaker in inhibiting aromatase yet still active.[2] The inhibition was thought to be indirect, as all compounds were fairly inactive in enzyme only assays (showing activity in cellular assays).[2]

Although linoleic acid was more effective than the reference drug aminoglutethimide in an enzyme assay, it was inactive in a cell assay;[2] this may be due to false positives associated with fatty acids in cell-free cultures.[3]


Some compounds of Brassaiopsis glomerulata\_ appear to be able to inhibit the aromatase enzyme

Interactions with Hormones

3.1

Testosterone

It has been noted that active components of Brassaiopsis glomerulata can inhibit the aromatase enzyme in vitro,[2] but no evidence currently exists to support an increase in testosterone or decrease in estrogen in a living system.
