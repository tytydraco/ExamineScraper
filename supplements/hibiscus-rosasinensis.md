### 1Sources and Composition

#### 1.1Sources


*Hibiscus rosasinensis* (of the family *Malvaceae*) is sometimes referred to as 'China Rose' and although it is mostly a decorative flower it appears to be used in hair growth and ulcer prevention.[[1]](#ref1) In pakistani medicine, it is referred to as either Gurhal, Jasun, Ghorawal, or Badsha pasant where the root is used for cough and the flowers for aphrodisiac, emollient and emmenagogue.[[2]](#ref2)


#### 1.2Composition


*Hibiscus rosasinensis* tends to contain:


* Cyanidin and Cyanin glucoside[[2]](#ref2)
* Hibiscetin[[2]](#ref2) and its glucoside Hibiscitrin[[3]](#ref3)
* Sabdaritrin and Gossypitrin[[3]](#ref3)
* Taraxeryl acetate[[2]](#ref2)
* β-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and ergosterol[[2]](#ref2)
* Citric, Tataric, and Oxalic acids[[2]](#ref2)

A preliminary screening has noted the presence of sterols, carbohydrates, glycosides, tannins and Flavonoids.[[1]](#ref1)

### 2Interactions with Glucose Metabolism

Oral ingestion of *Hibiscus rosasinensis* at 250-500mg/kg in alloxan-induced diabetic rats noted that acute ingestion of this herb resulted in reduced blood glucose relative to control, and to a similar degree than the active control of glibenclamide (10m/kg).[[4]](#ref4) Subchronic treatment over 7 days suggested that the 500mg/kg intake was similarly effective as 10mg/kg glibenclamide in these rats.[[4]](#ref4)

### 3Interactions with Hormones

#### 3.1Testosterone


One study conducted in rats given various extracts of *Hibiscus rosasinensis* noted a general body weight gain and increases in the weight of the testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle which was weakest with a cold water extract and highest with an alcoholic extract.[[5]](#ref5) The authors hinted at direct androgenic effects, and a possible phytoandrogen content.[[5]](#ref5)

### 4Interactions with Organ Systems

#### 4.1Stomach


At 250-500mg/kg extract weight and in response to carbachol (a cholinergic agent that can induce gastric acid secretion[[6]](#ref6)) China Rose was associated with less ulceration secondary to less acid secretion (dose-dependent, but to a small enough degree that both doses were similarly effect) which was thought to be due to anti-cholinergic effects.[[1]](#ref1)


#### 4.2Intestines


China Rose has been found to have calcium channel antagonistic effects (via causing dose-dependent relaxation of potassium-induced contraction), and it showed dose-dependent spasmogenic effects between 1-10mg/mL yet the maximum effect (81.43 + 0.93%) was lower than that of acetylcholine; all of which were antagonized by M3 receptor antagonists (atropine).[[2]](#ref2)
