Structure and Sources

L\-Threonate is a deriviative of L\-ascorbic acid 2\-phosphate (which in and of itself is a derivative of Ascorbic Acid, otherwise known as Vitamin C). 

2.

Effects on Hair Loss

L\-threonate is able to repress the expression of a gene known as dickkopf\-1 (DKK\-1\) which is upregulated by Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in male pattern baldness when co\-cultured.\[1] It seems to work similarily to L\-ascorbic acid 2\-phosphate via alkaline phosphatase activity and releasing ascorbic acid into the cell.\[2]\[3]

3.

Effects on Bone Metabolism

Independent of its use as a conjugate to Calcium as Calcium\-L\-Threonate (to be discussed), L\-Threonate has been investigated for its usage in bone health. It has been implicated as working synergistically with calcium in the production of collagen and mineralized nodules.\[4]\[5] and augments the uptake of ascorbic acid into fibroblasts.\[6] By itself, L\-threonate can also act on osteoclasts in an anti\-osteoporotic manner.\[7]

4.

Use as a mineral chelation

Minerals bound to L\-threonate tend to have rapid intestinal uptake and report minimal gastrointestinal side effects. Minerals such as Iron\[8]\[9], Calcium\[5], and Magnesium\[10]\[11] have been tested with L\-Threonate chelations.\[12]

5.

Safety and Toxicity

The safety and toxicity of L\-threonate has not been investigated.
