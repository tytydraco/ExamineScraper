Biological Significance

Silica is normally found in water as a free-floating mineral, and is said to be particularly abundant in glacial streams. Rather than existing as a stand-alone ion, silica tends to form various 'colloidal minerals' where silicon dioxide binds together and attracts water; this configuration sometimes traps other minerals such as potassium, magnesium, and free hydrogen ions within the silica colloids found in some water supplies.

It is claimed[1] that some long-living populations (Hunza, Pakistan) may partially credit their longevity to high silica levels in their water supply, which may hold basis as high silica concentrations in drinking water tend to ameliorate the negative effects of too much aluminum in the water when it comes to the elderly.[2]

1.3

Formulations and Variants

Silica Hydride refers to a polymeric colloid which is composed of silica, and contains numerous H- ions.[3]

Aerobic Cardiovascular Health

When six trained male cyclists were given either silica (as colloidal silicate) in three divided doses totalling 1g, for one week before a 40km bike ride, found that the group supplementing silica did not have any significant differences in heart rate, VO2 averages, workload averages or rate of perceived exertion; there was, however, less blood lactate produced in the supplement group compared to placebo.[1]

Skin

When tested in vitro (not skin cells, but rather CHO and NS-1), silica hydride appeared to protect the cells from light-induced damage claimed to be due to antioxidant properties.[3]
