Structure and Sources

Squalene is a Triterpenoid compound[1] that is synthesized in vivo by human livers as a precursor to cholesterol synthesis. Like many terpene compounds, squalene is fat-soluble.[2] Like cholesterol, it is secreted through the skin[3] and is important in the Skin Surface Lipid (SSL) film that protects the body from the external environment.[4]

It is widespread in nature, but most commonly found in Olive Oil, Shark Oil, Wheat Germ, and Rice Bran.[2] The squalene content of olive oil is variable between 3.6-9.6mg per gram of extra virgin olive oil.[5][6] The squalene content appears to be unaffected by heat processing.[7]

Shark liver oil appears to be 40% Squalene by weight.[8][2] The standard intake of squalene is 30mg per day with the Standard North American diet and up to 200-400mg a day in those who consume liberal amounts of olive oil or practitioners of the Mediterranean diet.[2]

Metabolism and Pharmacology

Squalene is a 6-isoprenoid unit containing triterpenoid. It is produced in vivo by (1) the conversion of Acetyl-CoA into HMG-CoA, the (2) reduction of HMG-CoA into mevalonate via HMG-CoA reductase, the (3) phosphrylation and decarboxylation of mevalonate to form delta 3-isopentenyl diphosphate, which is the donor molecule for polyprenyl compounds. D3IDP then (4) adds phenyl groups to form farnesyl diphosphate, and then (5) two farnesyl diphosphate molecules undergo a reactive coupling to form a single squalene molecule.[9] Due to squalene synthesis being downstream of HMG-CoA, statins (HMG-CoA) can inhibit in vivo squalene production.[10]

After synthesis (in the skin and liver), it is either secreted by sebaceous glands in the skin[11] or bound to LDL and vLDL for transport.[2]

If ingested, approximately 20% of squalene is cyclized into sterols and ejected back into the gut without being effectively taken up into systemic circulation.[12][13] Despite this, approximately 60-85% of orally ingested squalene is distributed to body tissues.[14][15]

Squalene and Cancer risk

Squalane initially interested cancer researchers with the observed correlation between a high amount of squalene in shark fatty tissues and the absence of cancer in this species[8][2] as well as possibly playing a significant role in lower cancer rates found with the Mediterranean Diet.[16][17]

It has been theorized that the mechanism of action by which squalene exerts anti-carcinogenic effects is through decreasing farnesyl pyrophosphate levels in cells, of which prenylation of FPP is required for oncogene activation.[5] A mechanism which has been suggested to reduce cancer risk without drastically altering the normal biochemicular pathway.[2][5]

The mechanism by which Squalene has been hypothesized to act is via increasing squalene levels in the body, sending inhibition via negative feedback to the HMG-CoA enzyme, and thus creating less synthesis of FPP.[5][18] This mechanism would mean protection for for breast, pancreatic, colon carcinomas, and similar tumors associated with oncogene mutations.

Beyond the main mechanisms, Squalene can also act as a free radical scavenger[18] and seems to enhance the anti-carcinogenic effect of co-ingested drug treatments.[19][20] and shows synergism against cancer with oleic acid, another constituent of olive oil.[21]

Squalene, via scavenging toxic metabolites, also show some promise in alleviating chemotherapy induced side-effects; although no applied trials have been conducted.[22][23]

Non-cancer uses of Squalene

Squalene can potentially protect the skin against oxidation and ultraviolet radiation. Its importance is illustrated by having 12% of overall bodily squalene content secreted from the skin[5], and it exhibiting antiradioactive and antioxidative properties[24] as well as shark oil being used with efficacy in treating some select skin conditions.[25]

Squalene can also be seen as anti-aging due to its protection of the skin (one symptom of aging) as well as enhancing the efficacy of the mitochondria.[26] And despite squalene inducing an oxygenating effect in cells (incorporating more oxygen for cellular reactions) it exerts an overall anti-oxidative effect.[2][27]

Squalene and Medicinal sciences

Squalene is commonly used as an adjuvant (a substance employed to increase or to modulate the immune response against an antigen[28]) as a squalene-in-water solution stabilized with polysorbate 80; it has been proven to be effective as an adjuvant with good chemicular stability.[29][30][31]

Safety profile

Although no acute toxicity has been reported with Squalene, there is no long term evidence for squalene consumption above the doses commonly found in foods.[2][32]
