MitoQ is a term used to refer to mitoquinone mesylate ( with {10-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-methyl-3,6-dioxo-1,4-cycloheexadienlyl) decyl triphenylphosphonium methanesulfonate}) as the prolonged chemical name), which is a derivative of CoQ10 where said molecule is covalently bonded to a triphenylphosphonium cation.

The CoQ10 moiety is delivered to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial matrix,[1] which is the site of most mitochondrial oxidative stress.[2] Despite accumulation in the mitrochondria, however, MitoQ is a poor substrate for the electron transport chain (at complex I) and is not thought to contribute much to bioenergetics.[3][4]

1.2

Biological Significance

Oral administration of MitoQ in otherwise healthy wild type mice over 28 weeks fails to significantly alter mitochondrial function or gene expression, and no overall influence on systemic energy metabolism.[5]

Dementia

Alzheimer's is known to be associated with mitochondrial abnormalities in neurons associated with oxidative stress[6][7]

Beta-amyloid toxicity has been noted to be reduced in N2a cells with MitoQ incubation[8] and at 1-100nM mostly abolished cell death from amyloid proteins (no dose dependence noted).[9]

100μM of MitoQ daily to a mouse model of Alzheimer's has been noted to improve spatial memory and cognitive performance associated with a reduction in lipid peroxidation.[9]
