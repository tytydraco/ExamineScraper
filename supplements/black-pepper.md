Sources and Pharmacology

Black Pepper (Piper Nigrum) is a common spice and herb used historically for various diseases related to gastrointesinal disorder and dental or oral dysfunction.\[1] It is most commonly known in the supplemental realm for its piperine content, but also contains pellitorine, guineensine, pipnoohine, trichostachine, and piperonal.\[1]

2.

Enterohepatic Effects

Piperine is known for changing metabolism of various drugs and supplements, most notably increasing curcumin bioavailability by 2000%.\[2] It affects metabolism by both intestinal absorption as well as downregulating or inhibiting phase II detoxification enzymes and the glucuronidation process in the liver.\[3] It may also contribute to increase absorption by slowing intestinal transit rate and thus prolonging the time said compounds are exposed to the potential uptake.\[4]

3.

Gastric and Systemic Effects

Piperine is able to slow both gastric emptying and intestinal transit at doses of 1mg/kg\-1\.3mg/kg bodyweight.\[4] In higher doses, it can induce gastric acid secretion possibly via agonism of gastric histamine H2 receptors.\[5]

4.

Safety and toxicity

There exist preliminary evidence that black pepper as a food substance poses carcinogenic effects via some procarcingenic constituents such as safrole and tannins, and some terpene compounds. These procarcinogenic effects were noted with topical application.\[6]: Evidence of carcinogenicity]. These effects, however, were not noted with oral ingestion\[7] despite rodent hypersensitivity to piperine.\[8]

It is generally recognized as safe for human consumption.\[9]
