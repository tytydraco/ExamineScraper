, Sources

, *Schizonepeta* (of the family *Labiatae*) is a genera of plants known as Japanese Catnip, of which *tenuifolia* is a particular medicinal species given the common name Jing Jie (China) and is used in [Traditional Chinese Medicine](/other/traditional-chinese-medicine/) (although *Schizonepeta Multifida* is sometimes also referred to as Jing Jie[[1]](#ref-1)), and known as Hyung-gae in Korea. This is different from 'True' Catnip, which is the genus *Nepeta* of the same plant family. 

, Japanese Catnip appears to be used to relieve body aches, as a hemostatic, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory drug, antipyretic, and antioxidant, as well as to treat the common cold, sore throat, allergic dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis.[[2]](#ref-2) It is sometimes presribed alongside *Ledebouriella seseloides* for both the common cold and skin rashes.[[1]](#ref-1)

, The dried above-ground parts of S. tenuifolia is often consumed in the East in sauce, beverage, beneficial tea or herbal medicine, with various quantities being added.[[3]](#ref-3) A 'carbonized' form is also sometimes used, particularly for bloody stool and metrorrhagia, is stirfried at a high temperature untilits exterior surface becomes blackish-brown and its interior surface turns dark yellow.[[1]](#ref-1)

, Leaf or leaf/stem (aerial parts) extracts have traditionally been dried and then used to fight off infections or allergies

, 1.2

, Composition

, The dry weight of the aerial (above ground) parts include:

, The effects of Japanese Catnip are most likely related to either the volatile oils of the monoterpenoids, but no evidence exists to suggest what bioactive(s) is/are the main ones; all studies currently just use water extracts of the aerial parts of the plant itself

, Total phenolics may reach 172mg/g (1.7%) dry leaf extract.[[3]](#ref-3)

, Pharmacology

, 2.1

, Phase I Enzyme Interactions

, Schizonepetin at an oral dose of 24mg/kg for seven days in rats appears to induce the activity of the CYP3A1/2 enzyme (assessed by dapsone pharmacokinetics, decreasing Cmax by 37% and increasing clearance by 63%); 24-48mg/kg, but not 12mg/kg, appears to induce the mRNA of this CYP isoform.[[10]](#ref-10)

, The same dose of schizonepetin appears to inhibit the CYP1A2 enzyme as assessed by phenacetin kinetics (increasing Cmax by 34% and overall AUC by 29.3%) and also inhibited CYP2E1 as assessed by chlorzoxazone kinetics (76% increase in Cmax and 36.1% increase in AUC).[[10]](#ref-10) CYP2D6 was also noted to be inhibited with a 51% and 147% increase in the Cmax and AUC of metoprolol, and the former two enzymes (CYP1A2 and CYP2E1) also noted an increase in mRNA levels at 24mg/kg or higher, but not 12mg/kg.[[10]](#ref-10)

, CYP2C19 appears to be unaffected by schizonepetin at the oral dose of 24mg/kg.[[10]](#ref-10)

, An oral dose of 24mg/kg schizonepetin in rats (estimated human equivalent of 3.84mg/kg) but not half the dose appears to be able to influence Phase I enzymes and possible alter drug pharmacokinetics

, 3.

, Inflammation and Immunology

, 3.1

, Mechanisms

, In isolated macrophages, Japanese Catnip appears to suppress TNF-α content at 50-200mcg/mL at 6 hours, with only the highest dose lasting to 24 hours; the inhibitory effect on IL-6 content was more insensitive, only occurring at the highest concentration at the 6 hour point.[[11]](#ref-11) TNF-α mRNA, but not IL-6, was suppressed with Japanese Catnip and thought to be related to inhibiting JNK/SAPK dependent c-Jun/ATF-2 activity; a member of the AP-1 family that is tied into TNF-α secretion.[[4]](#ref-4) MAPK inhibition has also been noted in macrophages, extending to all three subsets (p38, ERK, and JNK; upstream of AP-1).[[12]](#ref-12)

, In activated macrophages, Japanese Catnip extract appears to be anti-inflammatory. It is not as potent as reference drugs (Dexamethasone), but appears to suppress TNF-α more than IL-6 and may be selective (Dexamethasone, and many antiinflammatories, are universally antiinflammatory)

, 3.2

, Splenocytes

, At least one study assessing cell viability noted that 100mcg/mL of the water extract was not cytotoxic, but noted mitogenic activity to a level of 1.5-2.5 that of control cells.[[13]](#ref-13)

, May help proliferate immune cells, needs more resarch on the topic

, 3.3

, T-Cells

, In response to injected anti-CD3, the serum increase in IFN-γ and IL-4 mRNA expression is attenuated with prior administration of Japanese Catnip and differentation into Th1 and Th2 T-cells is attenuated.[[14]](#ref-14) A later study noted that Japanese Catnip at an oral dose of 100-500mg/kg of the water extract, after anti-CD3 injection, that the decrease in IFN-γ and IL-4 occurs to a degree larger than the mRNA reductions and serum IL-2 is increased.[[14]](#ref-14)[[13]](#ref-13) IFN-γ and IL-4 are cytokines normally increased in T-Cells in response to an antigen, with STAT4 and STAT6 being increased at a later point to sustain the elevation.[[15]](#ref-15) 

, The currently thought mechanism of action was noted *in vitro*, where Japanese Catnip could suppress NF-kB translocation while simultaneously promoting (NFAT)c2 translocation.[[13]](#ref-13) An increase in phosphorylation of both STAT4 and STAT6 is noted with Japanese Catnip, but is thought to not be causative of the above cytokine changes.

, Appears to possess anti-inflammatory effects in regards to T-cell differentiation, yet has some 'selective' effects where IL-2 is increased (Dexamethasone and many anti-inflammatories do not tend to influence IL-2 much) and can activate STAT4/6

, 3.4

, Allergic Reactions

, In human leukemic mast cells (HMC-1) using isolated compounds found in Japanese Catnip, 100mcg/mL of [ursolic acid](/supplements/ursolic-acid/), [rosmarinic acid](/supplements/rosmarinic-acid/), Pulegone, and 2α,3α,24-trihydroxyolean-12en-28oic acid were all able to significantly reduce Mast cell degranulation induced by either PMA or calcium ionophore (although this concentration of Ursolic acid was cytotoxic).[[2]](#ref-2) When measuring the release of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, it appeared that ursolic acid was most effective of the isolated ingredients yet the Japanese Catnip per se outperfomed all isolated components at 1mcg/mL (whereas it performed equally at 100mcg/mL.[[2]](#ref-2) This seemingly anti-allergic activity has been confirmed *in vivo* in mice fed Japanese Catnip prior to DNCB application[[16]](#ref-16) and has been noted to reduce mortality rates induced by compound 48/80 when 0.005-1g/kg is ingested and concurrently reduced histamine concentrations.[[17]](#ref-17)

, Appears to have anti-allergic effects by preventing mast cell degranulation, which have been confirmed in rodent models

, 3.5

, Interventions

, 50-1000mg/kg water extract of Japanese Catnip for 10 days prior to LPS injections (proinflammatory stimuli) noted that only 200-500mg/kg (not the highest tested doses) were able to suppress TNF-α induction by approximately half, with no significant effect on IL-6;[[11]](#ref-11) Dexamethasone as drug control significantly outperformed Japanese Catnip on reducing both cytokines (91% and 50%).[[11]](#ref-11)

, In a carrageenan-induced paw edema test, the reduction in antioxidative enzymes seen in control are attenuated at 500mg/kg to a similar degree as 10mg/kg Indomethacin (125-250mg/kg showing antioxidative effects, but to a lesser degree) and reduced both TNF-α, nitrate, and lipid peroxidation to similar degrees; Japanese Catnip at 500mg/kg appeared to be equally effective in reducing paw edema (indicative of inflammation associated with TNF-α and oxidation[[18]](#ref-18)) as 10mg/kg Indomethacin.[[3]](#ref-3)

, The anti-inflammatory effects are preliminary, with two animal studies being conducted; that being said, it appears to be moderately potent with 500mg/kg in rats being not significantly different than 10mg/kg Indomethacin, but weaker than Dexamethasone

, 4.

, Interactions with Oxidation

, 4.1

, Mechanisms

, *In vitro*, the dried aerial parts of Japanese Catnip show concentration-dependent antioxidative in assays on liposome protection, ABTS, and DPPH[[3]](#ref-3) with 0.2mg/mL of the water extract inhibiting up to 93.8+/-2.3% (ABTS) and 95.5+/-1.8% (DPPH) oxidation but only 31.1+/-3.8% Liposome protection.[[3]](#ref-3)

, Anti-oxidative effects have been noted *in vivo*, with 500mg/kg of the water extract of aerial parts being as effective as 10mg/kg Indomethacin in response to carrageenan injections.[[3]](#ref-3)

, Possesses anti-oxidative effects, practical relevance unknown

, 5.

, Interactions with Organ Systems

, 5.1

, Liver

, The two monoterpenes, Menthofuran and Pulegone, may metabolize into a compound known as *p-cresol* which has been shown to cause glutathione depletion in hepatocytes,[[19]](#ref-19)[[20]](#ref-20) although the volatile oil β-Myrcene appears to be hepatoprotective.[[21]](#ref-21) No studies have assessed the entire volatile oil essence of Japanese Catnip *per se*, so it is unknown what the overall effect is.

, Volatile oils in Japanese Catnip possess both hepatotoxic and hepatoprotective properties, with the practical significance of supplemental Japanese Catnip unknown

, 6.

, Interactions with Aesthetics

, 6.1

, Skin

, Anti-inflammatory properties of Japanese Catnip appears to exert protective effects against atopic dermatitis (as assessed by a mouse study inducing dematitis with DNCB).[[16]](#ref-16)

, Related to the anti-allergic mechanisms of action, Japanese Catnip may suppress skin eruptions in response to inflammation or allergins

, 7.

, Safety and Toxicology

, The LD50 of the fat-soluble extract of *Schizonepeta tenuifolia* (carbonized) appears to be 2.652+/-0.286g/kg (oral) and 1.945+/-0.207g/kg (injections) in mice and rabbits.[[1]](#ref-1)[[22]](#ref-22)
