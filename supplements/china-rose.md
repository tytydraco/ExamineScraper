Sources and Composition

1.1

Sources

Hibiscus rosasinensis (of the family Malvaceae) is sometimes referred to as 'China Rose' and although it is mostly a decorative flower it appears to be used in hair growth and ulcer prevention.\[1] In pakistani medicine, it is referred to as either Gurhal, Jasun, Ghorawal, or Badsha pasant where the root is used for cough and the flowers for aphrodisiac, emollient and emmenagogue.\[2]

1.2

Composition

Hibiscus rosasinensis tends to contain:

Cyanidin and Cyanin glucoside\[2]Hibiscetin\[2] and its glucoside Hibiscitrin\[3]Sabdaritrin and Gossypitrin\[3]Taraxeryl acetate\[2]Î²\-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and ergosterol\[2]Citric, Tataric, and Oxalic acids\[2]A preliminary screening has noted the presence of sterols, carbohydrates, glycosides, tannins and Flavonoids.\[1]

Interactions with Glucose Metabolism

Oral ingestion of Hibiscus rosasinensis at 250\-500mg/kg in alloxan\-induced diabetic rats noted that acute ingestion of this herb resulted in reduced blood glucose relative to control, and to a similar degree than the active control of glibenclamide (10m/kg).\[4] Subchronic treatment over 7 days suggested that the 500mg/kg intake was similarly effective as 10mg/kg glibenclamide in these rats.\[4]

Interactions with Hormones

3.1

Testosterone

One study conducted in rats given various extracts of Hibiscus rosasinensis noted a general body weight gain and increases in the weight of the testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle which was weakest with a cold water extract and highest with an alcoholic extract.\[5] The authors hinted at direct androgenic effects, and a possible phytoandrogen content.\[5]

Interactions with Organ Systems

4.1

Stomach

At 250\-500mg/kg extract weight and in response to carbachol (a cholinergic agent that can induce gastric acid secretion\[6]) China Rose was associated with less ulceration secondary to less acid secretion (dose\-dependent, but to a small enough degree that both doses were similarly effect) which was thought to be due to anti\-cholinergic effects.\[1]

4.2

Intestines

China Rose has been found to have calcium channel antagonistic effects (via causing dose\-dependent relaxation of potassium\-induced contraction), and it showed dose\-dependent spasmogenic effects between 1\-10mg/mL yet the maximum effect (81\.43 \+ 0\.93%) was lower than that of acetylcholine; all of which were antagonized by M3 receptor antagonists (atropine).\[2]
