Sources and Composition

1.1

Sources

Paederia foetida (family of Rubiaceae) is a plant from the Central and Eastern Himilayas growing at elevations of 5000m or above, and is called Prasarini in Hindi,[1] Gandhali,[2] and Akar Sekuntut in Malaysia.[3] It has some recorded usage for rheumatoid arthritis and for difficult labors as well as being an aphrodisiac, producing a youthful glow, and to enhance seminal parameters.

It is considered highly aromatic and is sometimes eaten as a culinary dish, either raw or steamed.[3]

Composition

Paederine, Paederone, Paederolone, and Paederenine[3]Hentriacontane[1]Hentriacontanol[1]Irioid Glycosides[4]Ceryl alcohol[1]Methylemercaptan[1]Palmitic Acid (dietary fatty acid)[1]Ursolic Acid[1]Stigmasterol, Campesterol, and Sitosterol[1]Over 77 components in the volatile oils have been noted.[5]

The phenolic content of fresh leaves can reach 62.64+/-1.32 while raw stems can reach 60.93+/-3.40 (mg/g ferulic acid equivalents); both of which decline upon drying.[3]

Neurology

2.1

Aphrodisia

In sexually mature rats given 50-200mg/kg of the ethanolic extract of Paederia foetida, aphrodisia was confirmed by an increase in mounting frequency (231%) and decrease in mounting latency (31.2%) paired with an increase in intromission frequency (222%) and decrease in intromission latency (21%); all effects were both dose and time dependent, with the peak values (given) being reached with 200mg/kg after 28 days.[1] The aphrodisiac effects (highest dose at 28 days) were comparable to the active control of 0.5mg/kg testosterone (injections) biweekly.[1]

Interactions with Hormones

3.1

Testosterone

An increase in serum testosterone has been noted in otherwise healthy rats given 100-200mg/kg of the ethanolic extract (not 50mg/kg) for 28 days, both of the higher doses appearing to fluctuate in the 4-4.5ng/mL range (value derived from chart) with control slightly below 2ng/L; barely significant increases in testosterone were noted at day 15 in the highest dose group only.[1]

Inflammation and Immunology

4.1

Mechanisms

Paederia foetida appears to have some anti-inflammatory effects as assessed by a granuloma formation test in mice, where injections of 100-200mg/kg Paederua foetida outperformed the active control (100mg/kg phenylbutazone).[6]

5.

Interactions with Oxidation

5.1

Mechanisms

The fresh leaves of Paederia foetida have been shown to have antioxidative potential in vitro with a potency greater than that of Quercetin but less than that of Vitamin E in a beta-carotene oxidation test.[3] Similar trends have been noted in an ABTS free radical test, with the leaves outperforming Quercetin but not surpassing Vitamin C as active control.[3]

6.

Interactions with Organs

6.1

Penis

A study conducted on male rats using 50-200mg/kg of the ethanolic extract for 28 days noted an increase in the penile erection index (PEI) with 100-200mg/kg at day 15 (175%, no dose dependence) and all doses at day 28 (154-289%); both of which outperformed the active control of 0.5mg/kg testosterone biweekly.[1]

6.2

Testes

28 days supplementation of 50-200mg/kg of the ethanolic extract of Paederia foetida was able to increase the weight of the testes (5.9%), epididymus (9.3%) and seminal vesicles (7.9%) with no apparent dose-dependence.[1] Upon histological examination, a slight vasodilatory effect and increased spermatid concentrations were noted in the testes and the Sertoli cells were enlarged and highly processed.[1]

6.3

Prostate

The one rat study using 50-200mg/kg of an ethanolic extract of Paederia foetida for 28 days noted that while there was a trend to increase prostate weight that this increase failed to reach statistical significance; the active control of 0.5mg/kg testosterone biweekly also failed to reach statistical significance.[1]

6.4

Intestines

In a castor-oil induced diarrhea test, 100-500mg/kg of the ethanolic extract of Paederia foetida was able to exert an acute anti-diarrhea effect with 500mg/kg only having significance up to 6 hours.[7] Anti-diarrheal effects were also noted in a Magnesium sulfate test, and tended to decrease intestinal motility induced by Barium Sulphate and Cisplatin.[7]
