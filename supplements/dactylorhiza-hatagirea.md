Dactylorhiza hatagirea (from the orchid family orchidaceae and synonymous with Orchis macula\[1]) is an aphrodisiac herb from Ayurveda and native to the Himilaya region (of altitudes of around ); it is known as a Vajikaran due to its reported ability to enhance male virility and strength.\[2] This plant is known in the local and surrounding regions by various names such as Hatta Haddi, Salam Panja, Wang lak, Lovha, Hathejadi, Panchaule, and Airula;\[3] it is medicinally used as a juice where it is drank to heal wounds, cuts, and gastritis\[3] beyond its usage as a sexual stimulant.\[1]\[2]


A basic history similar to most Vajikaran herbs, appears to be used to some limited medicinal purposes but most is just used as a sexual stimulant for men

Macrophages

In isolated RAW264 macrophages, a defatted water extract of dactylorhiza hatagirea was able to increase the release of nitric oxide by approximately 161%.\[2]

Interactions with Hormones

3.1

Androgens

200mg/kg of the water extract given to male rats daily over the course of 28 days is able to increase basal testosterone concentrations from 2\.33ng/mL to 9ng/mL (386% of baseline value; 286% increase).\[1]


Lone study has noted an increase in testosterone with the libido enhancing dosage of the herb

Sexuality and Pregnancy

4.1

Libido

200mg/kg of a lysophilized extract of the roots of dactylorhiza hatagirea for 28 days is able to enhance male rat attraction towards females (2\.5\-fold) and was able to modify mount latency (36% reduction) and post\-ejaculatory latency (36%) in a manner suggesting libido enhancement.\[1]

There is an increase in the penile erection index seen with 100mg/kg of dactylorhiza hatagirea (defatted water extract) daily for two weeks to rats, although this was less than the benefit seen with Curculigo orchioides and Chlorophytum borivilianum.\[2] This has been noted elsewhere with 200mg/kg of the root water extract over 28 days.\[1]


Appears to have libido enhance properties, and when compared against other ayuvedic herbs on the penile erection index it appeared to be less potent


4.2

Fertility

In male rats, 100mg/kg of a defatted water extract of dactylorhiza hatagirea given orally over the course of two weeks was able to increase sperm count by 28\.22%;\[2] a potency comparable to the same dosage of Chlorophytum borivilianum, Asparagus racemosus, and Curculigo orchioides\[2] but was not associated with increased fructose content of the spermatids.


The ability of this herb to increase sperm count is comparable to other ayurvedic herbs, although it appears less effective at increasing nutritional parameters of the sperm (ie. fructose content)
